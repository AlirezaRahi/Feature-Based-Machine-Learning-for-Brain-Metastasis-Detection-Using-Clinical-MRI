## Overview

This project implements a comprehensive machine learning pipeline for detecting brain metastases from MRI scans. The system processes T1-pre and T1-post contrast MRI images, extracts advanced radiomic features, and employs ensemble learning techniques with cross-validation to achieve high diagnostic accuracy.

## Features

- **Advanced Image Processing**: Automated cropping, padding, and normalization of 3D MRI volumes
- **Comprehensive Feature Extraction**: Intensity-based, enhancement, texture, and histogram features
- **Data Augmentation**: Specialized techniques for handling class imbalance
- **Cross-Validation**: Robust 5-fold stratified cross-validation for reliable performance estimation
- **Multiple Classifiers**: Comparison of Random Forest, SVM, and Gradient Boosting models
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: ROC curves, confusion matrices, and detailed classification reports

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- NIfTI file support for medical imaging data

### Dependencies

Install required packages:

```bash
pip install nibabel numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn joblib imbalanced-learn
```

### Data Setup

1. Organize your dataset in the following structure:
```
dataset_directory/
â”œâ”€â”€ patient_1/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ T1pre.nii.gz (or similar naming)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ T1post.nii.gz (or similar naming)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ segmentation.nii.gz (or mask.nii.gz)
â”œâ”€â”€ patient_2/
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

2. Update the `base_directory` path in the `train_with_cross_validation()` function to point to your dataset.

## Usage

### Basic Training

Run the complete training and evaluation pipeline:

```bash
python brain_mets_detection.py
```

### Customization

Modify these parameters in the code for your specific needs:

```python
# Adjust these parameters as needed
dataset = BrainMetsDataset(
    base_dir=base_directory, 
    max_patients=50,           # Set to None to use all patients
    target_shape=(128, 128, 64) # Adjust based on your data characteristics
)
```

### Outputs

The script generates:
- Model file: `final_model.pkl`
- ROC curve: `roc_curve_cv.png`
- Confusion matrix: `confusion_matrix_cv.png`
- Console output with comprehensive evaluation metrics

## Methodology

### Data Processing
1. **Image Loading**: NIfTI files are loaded and converted to numpy arrays
2. **Preprocessing**: Images are cropped/padded to a consistent size (128Ã—128Ã—64)
3. **Normalization**: Intensity values are clipped and standardized

### Feature Extraction
- **Intensity Features**: Mean, standard deviation, percentiles
- **Enhancement Features**: Difference between T1-post and T1-pre contrasts
- **Texture Features**: Gradient-based texture analysis
- **Histogram Features**: Intensity distribution characteristics

### Modeling
- **Class Imbalance Handling**: Manual data augmentation with noise injection
- **Model Selection**: Comparison of Random Forest, SVM, and Gradient Boosting
- **Validation**: 5-fold stratified cross-validation
- **Evaluation**: Comprehensive metrics including ROC AUC, precision, recall, and F1-score

## Results

The model achieves the following performance metrics:

| Evaluation Metric | Value | Description & Interpretation |
|-------------------|-------|------------------------------|
| **Overall Accuracy** | 96.67% (87/90) | The proportion of total correct predictions (both classes) out of all predictions. Indicates a highly accurate model. |
| **ROC AUC Score** | 0.988 | Area Under the ROC Curve. A score near 1.0 indicates excellent class separation capability. |
| **Precision (No Metastasis)** | 1.00 | No False Alarms: When the model predicts "No Metastasis," it is always correct. Crucial to avoid unnecessary stress or procedures. |
| **Recall/Sensitivity (No Metastasis)** | 0.93 | Coverage: Correctly identifies 93% of actual healthy cases; 7% (3 cases) missed. |
| **F1-Score (No Metastasis)** | 0.96 | Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall for the "No Metastasis" class, showing strong balance. |
| **Precision (Metastasis)** | 0.94 | Reliability: When predicting "Metastasis," correct 94% of the time; few false positives occur. |
| **Recall/Sensitivity (Metastasis)** | 1.00 | Critical Performance: Identifies 100% of actual metastatic cases; vital to avoid missing serious conditions. |
| **F1-Score (Metastasis)** | 0.97 | Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall for the "Metastasis" class, indicating strong balance. |
| **Macro Avg F1-Score** | 0.97 | Unweighted average F1-score across both classes, showing excellent overall performance. |
| **False Positives (FP)** | 3 | Healthy cases incorrectly predicted as metastatic (Type I error). |
| **False Negatives (FN)** | 1 | Metastatic cases incorrectly predicted as healthy (Type II error); critical to minimize. |
| **Total Support** | 90 | Evaluation performed on 44 "No Metastasis" and 46 "Metastasis" samples. |
